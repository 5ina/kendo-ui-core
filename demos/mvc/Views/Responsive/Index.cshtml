    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>The concept of responsive design suggests that the layout of the project needs to adapt to the media that renders it. Media queries are one of the cornerstones of Responsive Web Design. By adding some filter criteria around CSS definitions, we can control under which conditions rules are applied to Kendo UI widgets.</p>
