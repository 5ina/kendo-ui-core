# Deprecation Notice

The hybrid mobile components of Kendo UI and especially the AngularJS integration of the Hybrid UI toolkit is mostly superseded by [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/).

At the time of its implementation, the AngularJS router was rather unsuitable for the purpose of mobile development and the integration did not provide a successful and stable solution.

The available documentation resources on the Kendo UI hybrid mobile components are intended to serve maintenance issues.

It is strongly recommended that you use the NativeScript approach as it is much more advantageous and beneficial as compared to the hybrid solution.
