# Custom Page Layout

> **Important**
>
> This example used to demonstrate how to scale the Grid and add a header and footer using Drawing API shapes.
> It is now obsoleted built-in functionality. Refer to the [PDF Export - Page Template]({% slug exporting_pdf_kendoui_grid_widget %}#page-template) section.
>
> The built-in method also guarantees that you'll get uniform scale factor across all pages. Something that wasn't true for this sample.
