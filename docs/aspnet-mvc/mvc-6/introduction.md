# Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC 6 - Beta 7
This tutorial shows how to use Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC in ASP.NET MVC 6 applications.

> The ASP.NET 5 Framework is still actively developed. Tooling and APIs change frequently, often requiring extensive changes.
See [Known Issues](known-issues) for up-to-date information.

# Requirements and Supported Environments

We target the stable release of the ASP.NET 5 framework. At the time of this writing this is Beta 7.

The target runtime is [CoreCLR](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr). The full desktop CLR is also supported.

# ASP.NET Resources

The [ASP.NET 5 Documentation](http://docs.asp.net/en/latest/index.html) is a great place to get started.

The following repositories contain source code, instructions and issue trackers for the ASP.NET project.
These are immensely useful when you need to track down particular issues or behaviors.

- [ASP.NET Home](https://github.com/aspnet/home) on GitHub
- [ASP.NET MVC](https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc) main repository
- [ASP.NET MVC Announcements](https://github.com/aspnet/announcements/) for important changes

# Running the Sample Application on Windows

The sample application is currently targeting MVC Beta 6 and is not runnable with Beta 7.

The next official release (2015 Q3 Beta) will address this.
