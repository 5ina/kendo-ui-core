# Export Grid Data to Excel

The example below demonstrates how to export big datasets from the Grid to Excel by using the [Telerik RadSpreadProcessing](/devtools/document-processing/libraries/radspreadprocessing/overview), which is part of the [Telerik Document Processing by Progress](/devtools/document-processing/introduction).
