# Scheduler Scaffolding

This chapter provides information on how to scaffold a Kendo UI Scheduler for ASP.NET MVC using the Kendo UI Scaffolder Visual Studio extension.

> The Kendo UI Scaffolder will not include the required UI for ASP.NET MVC files in your project:  
> - To automatically add them, use the [Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC Visual Studio Extensions](/aspnet-mvc/vs-integration/introduction).  
> - To manually add them, follow the steps demonstrated [here](/aspnet-mvc/asp-net-mvc-5).

# Getting Started

1. Create a new ASP.NET MVC application, include an Entity Framework Data Model and add Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC. On how to do this, follow steps 1-5 from the [Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC in MVC 5 Applications tutorial](/aspnet-mvc/helpers/scheduler/ajax-editing#getting-started). 
 
2. Right-click on the location where the `Scheduler Controller` should be generated. Select **Add** -> **New Scaffolded Item...** from the displayed menu. In this example we generate it in the `Controllers` folder:  
![New Scaffolded Item](/aspnet-mvc/helpers/scheduler/images/scaffolding/scheduler_new_scaffolded_item.png)
 

3. Select **Kendo UI Scaffolder** from the list of available scaffolders. Then choose the desired Scheduler option:

4. The next screen displays the `Model` and `Data Context` options:
    - Enter the `Controller` and `View` names:

    - The **Model Class** DropDownList contains all model types from the active project. In this example we list products in the Scheduler. Select the `Product` entity:

    - From the **Data Context Class** DropDownList you can select the **Entity Framework Data Model** class to be used. In this example we select **SampleEntities**. Note that the DataBase used is taken from the [offline examples](/aspnet-mvc/introduction#running-the-sample-application):

5. Select the fields from your original model that match the fields from the required `ISchedulerEvent` interface. The Scaffolder automatically generates a view model that inherits from the `ISchedulerEvent` interface. This view model includes a constructor and a method that map the view model fields to the original model:  
![View Model Fields Selection](/aspnet-mvc/helpers/scheduler/images/scaffolding/ui_for_aspnetmvc_scheduler_4.png)  
The newly created class will later be added to the `~/Models` folder:  
![View Model Class](/aspnet-mvc/helpers/scheduler/images/scaffolding/ui_for_aspnetmvc_scheduler_7.png)
  
6. Click **Scheduler Options**:  
![Scheduler options](/aspnet-mvc/helpers/scheduler/images/scaffolding/ui_for_aspnetmvc_scheduler_5.png)
This screen contains the Scheduler functionalities that can be configured before scaffolding:  
	- **DataSource Type** - Ajax or WebApi
	- **Edit Operations** - configure the operations to be included (**Create**, **Update**, **Destroy**, **Move**, **Resize**)  
    - **PDF Export** - enable the PDF export functionality
    - **Selectable** - enable the selection functionality  
    - **Views** - select the desired views to be included 

7. Click **Events** and select the Scheduler events that you want to attach handlers to:

8. When finished with the Scheduler configuration, click **Add**. The `Scheduler Controller` and the corresponding `View` are now generated.
