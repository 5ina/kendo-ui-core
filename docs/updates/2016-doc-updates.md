### Creation of New Files

In addition to the renaming and relocation of the above articles, some new ones are now created&mdash;from scratch or as a result of splitting existing ones&mdash;to the purpose of making the documented information more handy.

* A new troubleshooting article on Scaffolding when using the Kendo UI Scaffolder Visual Studio Extension is now available. Go to **UI for ASP.NET MVC** > **Troubleshooting** > **Scaffolding** to check it out.
* A new troubleshooting article on Validation is now available. Go to **UI for ASP.NET MVC** > **Troubleshooting** > **Validation** to check it out.
* The **Globalization and Localization** article on Telerik UI for ASP.NET MVC is now split to list the two topics separately for a better navigation. The current location of them both is **UI for ASP.NET MVC** > **Globalization** and **UI for ASP.NET MVC** > **Localization** respectively.

## Kendo UI Q1 2016

Below are listed the latest (Kendo UI Q1 2016 release) changes in the documentation as compared to the Kendo UI Q3 2015 ones.

### File Reorganization and Relocation

* The conceptual topic documentation on Kendo UI widgets is reorganized to correspond to the structure of the [Kendo UI live demo page](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/). The articles on Kendo UI controls are now listed in the **Widgets** folder. For example, **Widgets** > **Data Management** > **Grid** > **Overview**.
* The new **Styles and Appearance** folder contains the combined articles on the layout and general appearance of the Kendo UI widgets that were previously referred to as Web and DataViz, such as the **Responsive Web Design** and **ThemeBuilder Overview** help topics.
* The recently added **Third-Party Frameworks and Utilities** folder accommodates the articles on Kendo UI integration with third-party frameworks, such as the **TypeScript** and **RequireJS** help topics.
* The newly created **Troubleshooting** folder holds all existing general Kendo UI issues, which are now split into topics, so that a particular issue can be much more easily located. This approach resulted in articles such as **Performance Issues** and **Content Security Policy**.
* The new **Backwards Compatibility** folder contains all Kendo UI breaking changes now divided depending on the year of their release.
* The headings in nearly half of the existing help topics are now shortened and improved with a focus on building a much clearer and easy-to-access internal structure as well as suiting the new web design of the Documentation hub. The work on building a consistent style of inter-linking related topics via the newly-added **See Also** section is going on, too.
