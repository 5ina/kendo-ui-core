## Description

I am using your grid, and have numbers coming back with up to 16 decimal places.  The numbers show up great in the grid, however every time I go to edit the grid, it cuts the number way down to like 3 decimal places.  I tried creating a custom grid editor for the NumericTextBox in the editor and it  does not seem to do anything.  

## Solution
  
Please refer to the following [example](http://dojo.telerik.com/OSola) demonstrating how to achieve the desired result.
